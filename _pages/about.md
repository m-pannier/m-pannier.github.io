## Welcome!

I am a PhD student at [LMU Munich](https://www.econ.lmu.de/en/) and a guest PhD student at [ifo Institute](https://www.ifo.de/en). 

My interests lie in Public Economics, Political Economy and Applied Microeconomics.

In my current research, I work at the intersection of theory and empirics with a focus on the design and potential reforms of tax-transfer systems.
